# Changelog

## 1.6.9 - 2026-09-30

- ABC 原生子集校验失败时显示双声部 group、精确行号、期望标记与实际行内容；`V:Ins` 等仅缺空格的情况给出直接修正提示。
- 乐谱计划页新增免费本地“校验当前 ABC”入口，失败后自动选中出错行，避免提交生成任务后才发现格式问题。
- 修正重新编曲草稿覆盖全局显存加载方式的问题，低显存设置现在会在四个创作页面同步并在刷新后保持。
- README 补充 awesome-YuE 社区生态清单链接与致谢。

## 1.6.8 - 2026-09-20

- 修复 MuLaCover 低显存单批次分支重复取出已弹出的张量，避免触发 `KeyError` 并确保动态显存保护实际生效。

## 1.6.7 - 2026-09-20

- Add a visible VRAM status and cleanup action. The action clears allocator blocks owned by the service process, reports before/after NVIDIA memory, and leaves running isolated workers untouched unless the user explicitly cancels them.
- Pass memory budget and loading mode through MuLaCover remix requests and resume actions. MuLaCover now adapts batch size to the current free VRAM, lowers CFG only in low-memory single-batch mode, and sizes KV caches to the requested song duration instead of always allocating the full 8192-token cache.
- Record the selected memory policy in MuLaCover metadata and improve OOM recovery guidance in the WebUI.

## 1.6.6 - 2026-09-19

- Add the requested Bilibili, YouTube, API signup, RunningHub, portable package and Hugging Face profile links to the studio header, public README and distribution documentation.
- Keep the social and distribution links visible on narrow screens through the existing responsive wrapping layout.



## 1.6.5 - 2026-09-19

- Make the public MuLaCover manifest portable by replacing local absolute paths with model-root-relative paths.
- Pin the installer to the final Hugging Face model tree after the manifest privacy fix.

## 1.6.4 - 2026-09-19

- Mirror the complete YuE2 style-training `regularizer-safe-v1` cache in `t8star/YuE2-Comfy`, including codec, offsets and metadata.
- Add the root `MULACOVER_MODEL_MANIFEST.json` to the model repository so MuLaCover provenance and checksums are available after a clean download.
- Pin the installer to the verified Hugging Face commit containing the new model structure.
- Document the shared model tree and the three root manifests in the installation instructions.

## 1.6.3 - 2026-09-19

- Make the MIDI workspace use the full available width instead of leaving large side gutters.
- Move the MuLaCover generation panel below the editor at medium window widths so the piano roll remains usable.
- Add a real horizontal scroll area for long and zoomed piano-roll timelines.
- Give audio-to-MIDI start, end and BPM inputs equal flexible widths so the BPM field is never clipped.

## 1.6.2 - 2026-09-19

- Keep the most recent audio selection when earlier uploads or asset reads finish late in the same MIDI document.
- Reject generation preparation when the editor switches documents during a check, confirmation or snapshot response; retained fixed inputs remain available.
- Export a requested MIDI role without expanding unrelated tracks or imposing their voice limits on the requested file.
- Synchronize BPM and editor controls during undo/redo, and keep a valid active track when undo removes a newly added chord track.
- Remove only exact matching failed-draft recovery snapshots after the owning page saves successfully, preserving other pages' different unsaved edits.
- Add real-service browser checks for source ordering, document switches, actual tempo export, active-track transposition and shared-storage cleanup, plus a single-role export regression.

## 1.6.1 - 2026-09-19

- Prevent repeated audio-to-MIDI submissions while a document save is pending; failed submissions unlock retry.
- Reset the saved source clip range and recognition BPM when choosing new music, keeping refresh behavior consistent with the displayed range.
- Restore the original melodic channel when changing a percussion track back to melody or chords, including channel-bearing controller messages.
- Keep failed drafts independent across browser tabs; recovering one snapshot removes only matching backups and retains other unsaved edits.
- Name the source-audio player for assistive navigation and add real-browser regressions for role changes, source persistence, slow-save submissions and shared-storage recovery.

## 1.6.0 - 2026-09-19

- Add a project-scoped MIDI editor with real note/chord editing, role mapping, local WebAudio audition, undo, transposition, touch controls, standard MIDI export and persistent drafts.
- Add independent audio-to-melody/chord/drums MIDI extraction using only transcription weights, with real progress, partial-result persistence, cancellation, retry and raw-event cache reuse.
- Generate MuLaCover songs from immutable edited MIDI snapshots, retain prior completed audio across later extraction/failure/cancellation, and connect outputs to the asset library and existing voice conversion.
- Preserve original PPQ, tempo and controller events in normal MIDI exports; explicitly confirm quantized model copies without modifying the original material.
- Recover independent unsaved snapshots across reloads, separate conflict-copy operations from failed saves, protect published source references and add paginated document/archive/cache management.
- Guard finite audio exports and apply one global peak gain before PCM24 saving to avoid clipping model outputs.
- Validate actual portable native startup, generation, independent transcription, source artifact hashes and preservation of existing user projects/settings. The user confirmed both controlled 30-second samples sound normal; this listening acceptance is separate from waveform checks and limited to those samples.

## 1.5.12 - 2026-09-18

- Prevent duplicate paid assistant submissions before configuration/draft saves complete; wait before project changes and continue tracking submitted jobs when draft persistence fails.
- Constrain asset purge to its approved preview, scan past protected trash batches and expose occupied waveform or zero-byte GC retries.
- Preserve retryable job control records during partial Windows/manual or policy cleanup; reject directory junctions and mark partially cleaned results unavailable.
- Discard stale training-project and style-model reads, align resized asset pages, open active training assets and persist model handoffs.
- Translate the instrumental checkbox into explicit native no-vocal text conditions and the instrumental lyric marker (Issue #12); this remains model guidance.
- Add optional MuLaCover style conditioning using the upstream empty-tag behavior (Issue #13), preserving legacy drafts and API defaults without promising identical arrangements.

## 1.5.9 - 2026-09-17

- Shorten atomic checkpoint staging directories and JSON temporary filenames so deeply nested reference-cover jobs fit the legacy Windows path limit without sacrificing complete-checkpoint publication or unique concurrent writes.
- Keep final checkpoint names and manifests compatible with existing jobs; clean temporary JSON files when serialization or replacement fails.
- Add storage regressions for the reported 262-character path, near-limit directories, cancellation and concurrent JSON writers, including the Windows CI job.
- Fix the unanchored model-data ignore rule that omitted MuLaCover codec and torchtune Python sources from GitHub/Registry/code ZIPs; validate required sources in readiness and release archives (Issue #9).

## 1.5.8 - 2026-09-16

- Fix project asset pagination when one revision has multiple project roles, reject ambiguous voice booleans and empty pitch controls, and localize malformed request errors.
- Keep invalid ABC recovery guidance visible, add copy confirmation, remove late assistant initialization overwrites, and make mobile asset pagination, keyboard entry and repeated control names accessible.
- Exit the Windows launcher after a successful start so in-app updates can replace it; publish Registry packages only from immutable version tags whose complete Quality workflow passed.
- Exclude development-only CI/tests from code update ZIPs, keep runtime verification read-only, and pin all release actions to reviewed commit SHAs.

## 1.5.7 - 2026-09-16

- Replace blocking browser alerts, confirmations and text prompts with accessible in-studio dialogs for project, model, cleanup and update actions.
- Restore the latest project-scoped AI creation even after any number of later model connection tests by filtering tests before pagination.
- Align the stable release tag with a fully passing Linux/browser and Windows launcher/update CI run.

## 1.5.6 - 2026-09-16

- Serialize job status updates across the service and worker so a last-moment cancel can no longer overwrite a committed result.
- Recover the active job and project-scoped assistant result beyond the recent-task window; show the real queue total and hide non-exportable housekeeping tasks from export actions.
- Page through every training run and project asset instead of silently stopping at 200 or 500 records; keep project tracks and linked assets bounded to 8 and 10 items per page.
- Disable AI actions until the selected API credential or local GGUF is ready, surface model-list failures, disambiguate trained style models, and improve technical audio-component errors.
- Add keyboard skip navigation, clearer mobile labels and compact non-project headers, plus Windows launcher version metadata and CI coverage.

## 1.5.5 - 2026-09-16

- AI 创作助手的新安装默认使用 32K 输出预算，云端与兼容接口允许设置到 262,144 Token，覆盖 220K 需求；实际可用值仍由模型和渠道限制。
- 切换本地 GGUF 时独立恢复保守的 4K 输出预算，避免云端大额度超过本地上下文；界面同时说明费用和模型限制。

- Keep asset-library and completed-job audio on the server during cross-workspace handoff instead of downloading the whole file into browser memory and uploading it again.
- Add native ComfyUI nodes for YuE2 style training, trained LoRA selection and strength, RVC voice loading, RVC training and RVC song conversion.
- Allow completed YuE2 training output to connect directly to song generation and completed RVC training output to connect directly to RVC conversion.
- Preserve manual uploads while clearly tracking server-side audio and MIDI references across previews, transcription, RVC import, MuLaCover and voice conversion.

## 1.5.2 - 2026-09-16

- Require verified, separated vocals for RVC training and reject unreviewed or mixed material before GPU work starts.

- Recover stale updater transactions after a crashed process and include RVC and MuLaCover model setup in the unified installer.
- Add a four-step first-run guide, correct mobile training layout and validate desktop, tablet and phone workflows in the browser smoke suite.

## 1.5.1 - 2026-09-16

- Accept `127.0.0.1`, `localhost` and IPv6 loopback aliases for browser POST requests when the port matches, preventing valid local pages from being rejected as cross-site requests.
- Continue rejecting non-loopback origins, browser-extension origins and loopback pages on another port.

## 1.5.0 - 2026-09-15

- Limit task history to ten records per page while preserving filters and navigation.

## 1.4.19 - 2026-09-15

- Let every YuE2 training song use a manually entered style, a saved style asset, or the shared fallback style.
- Add a persistent completed-model panel with completed and selected steps, losses, rank, size, local path, model download, folder access and one-click use in song creation.
- Identify byte-identical duplicate imports by both visible filenames before rejecting a train/validation split.

## 1.4.18 - 2026-09-15

- Persist each paid AI Assistant checkpoint as soon as it reaches the browser, so later ABC work cannot hide already generated lyrics or style text.
- Restore the latest project-scoped Assistant task from the durable job store after workspace switches, reloads, and browser restarts, even when the draft did not record its job ID.
- Recheck the current Assistant task whenever its workspace opens while preserving deliberate user edits.

## 1.4.17 - 2026-09-15

- Migrate older assistant drafts from the former downstream ABC default while preserving deliberate downstream choices saved by the new draft format.
- Make YuE2 quick training (200 steps) the default and align its underlying advanced parameters with that preset.

- Let every YuE2 training song use pasted lyrics, a linked lyrics asset, the optional shared fallback, or an explicit instrumental flag.
- Replace silent native form blocking with an inline validation and background-preprocessing status beside the training action.

## 1.4.15 - 2026-09-15

- Scope YuE2 training songs to the current project and refresh them whenever the training workspace opens, removing the stale empty list seen after adding assets.
- Add “添加歌曲”, guided asset-library and direct-import paths; explain that an audio asset becomes trainable after it is added to the current project.
- Skip byte-identical files during automatic updates, avoiding Windows launcher replacement failures when the unchanged native launcher is temporarily locked.

## 1.4.14 - 2026-09-15

- Make AI provider readiness visible before creation, with a direct API Key setup button and the selected provider's registration link.
- Detect expired session-only credentials after restart, automatically expand channel settings, and prevent credential-less assistant jobs from entering the queue.
- Add one-click API Key recovery to credential failure results, preserving keyboard focus and responsive layout across desktop, tablet and phone widths.

## 1.4.13 - 2026-09-15

- Gate RVC output from the separated source-vocal envelope so instrumental leakage cannot become sustained synthetic tones.
- Save and restore Korean and other UTF-8 symbolic plans independently of the Windows system locale.

## 1.4.5 - 2026-09-15

- Keep every asset-card action inside its card at desktop widths, including the fourth “Add to project” action.
- Reset the page position when switching workspaces and immediately remove stale result banners from unrelated pages.
- Give dynamic asset dialogs accessible names and replace browser-default required-field messages with Chinese guidance.

- Keep the GitHub updater archive code-only. It excludes Python, models, GGUF files, user data and the private roadmap.

## 1.4.1 - 2026-09-14

- Make model settings reachable from every workbench page and simplify mobile navigation, tap targets, assistant setup and YuE2 training presets.
- Keep project-scoped assistant, creation, score and cover drafts isolated across initial selection, switching, archiving, refresh and failed draft loads; assistant tasks now retain their project scope.
- Add asset paging, editing, text revisions and direct transfer into song creation, score planning, reference-voice cover and RVC training while keeping training inputs independent from asset filters.

- Add type, project, status and text filters to paged task history; refresh the active project after completed jobs and keep unrelated results off the current page.
- Add the missing favicon and responsive/accessibility fixes. GitHub updater artifacts remain code-only and contain no Python runtime, models, GGUF files or user data.

## 1.4.0 - 2026-09-14

- Redesign the standalone WebUI as a connected music workbench while preserving the established light blue-gray and berry palette.
- Add projects and a content-addressed asset library for songs, vocals, instrumentals, reference voices, lyrics, scores, works and trained models, with waveform previews and revision-pinned project links.
- Add YuE2 AR LoRA song-style training from immutable train/validation snapshots, pinned Mothersuperior v4 tokenizer/NAR resources, MERT features, loss charts, safe pause/resume and a model library.
- Pair trained AR adapters with the pinned v4 NAR companion during direct generation, record full model provenance, and generate playable short checkpoint previews inside the training page.
- Require a recorded rights confirmation for YuE2 training snapshots and auto-promote completed audio and model outputs into the current project and asset library.
- Keep generation, transcription, Seed-VC, RVC, YuE2 training and local GGUF in the single verified CPython 3.12.10 runtime; code-only updates still exclude Python, models and user data.

## 1.3.1 - 2026-09-14

- Allow ComfyUI users to select realistic memory budgets below 12 GiB or above 24 GiB.
- Resume failed generation with the current memory budget instead of silently reusing the failed value.
- Choose VAE decode tiles from the smaller of physical VRAM and the configured budget, with validated explicit overrides.
- Reject experimental FP8 on HIP/ROCm and report CUDA/HIP accelerators without NVIDIA-only wording.
- Warn before replacing local code, require repository quality checks, and fail Registry publishing when a version is not accepted.
- Include the merged HIP/ROCm decode and Seed-VC compatibility fixes from PR #2.

## 1.3.0 - 2026-09-12

- Unify generation, transcription, Seed-VC, RVC and GGUF under CPython 3.12.10 / Torch 2.10.0 + CUDA 12.8; keep sequential subprocess model release.

- Add validated storage migration for training projects/cache, datasets and voices, preserving original backups and resumable migration state.
- Convert existing songs directly or compare Seed-VC and RVC sequentially using a verified shared Demucs cache. Preserve playable successful candidates when the other backend fails.
- Migrate legacy runtimes transactionally during updates, verify new service startup, and roll back code/runtime on failure. Retire the old code-only patch installer.
- Package optional prebuilt/local SM120 FlashAttention wheels; standalone flash_attn is not enabled in song generation.
- Verify GPU/CPU compatibility, long repeated-audio conversion, checkpoint recovery and browser workflows. Voice-quality benchmarks and physical low-VRAM GPU support are not claimed.

## 1.2.2 - 2026-09-12

- Add a visible update control to the WebUI status card and automatically check the stable GitHub Release channel when the page opens.
- Download and validate the project-bound update manifest and code archive before installation, including the release URL, archive root, size limits, and SHA256.
- Install updates through a separate process, preserve models, runtimes, local LLM files, works, uploads, drafts, settings, logs, and caches, then restart the same local port.
- Back up every replaced file and automatically restore the previous code if the updated service cannot start.

## 1.2.1 - 2026-09-12

- Add channel-specific default models: `bytedance/doubao-seed-evolving` for ZhenZhen Affordable AI Shop and `gemini-3.5-flash` for ZhenZhen AI Workshop.
- Add searchable provider model choices and a bounded OpenAI-compatible `/models` refresh. A failed LIST request keeps the defaults and manual model-ID input available.
- Add the two provider registration links beside the channel settings so users can obtain the matching API key without searching elsewhere.

## 1.2.0 - 2026-09-11

- Add a standalone AI creation tab with the T8 project's pinned YuE2 skill rules, API provider options and isolated local GGUF support; no new ComfyUI nodes.
- Edit, save and transfer lyrics, style and validated ABC between tabs, with revision checks, overwrite review, undo and result restoration after refresh.
- Preserve completed text on failures; resume only failed stages and reuse successful responses. Keep API credentials out of jobs and prevent repeated submissions from creating duplicate paid tasks.
- Add a pinned Windows GGUF runtime installer, verified resumable downloads, packaged CUDA dependencies and metadata/shard checks without importing Torch into the LLM worker.
- Preserve assistant drafts and local models during updates; use the memory-saving generation default when importing an external score into the plan page.
- Verify the Seedance API, imported-score audio generation, browser workflows and error recovery. Local Qwen 27B lyrics/style generation passes; constrain response fields to avoid placeholder/wrong-field output. Reject over-budget prompts without truncating lyrics.
- Make the local GGUF directory optional and add a separate model download link. API users do not need local LLM weights. Local ABC quality remains model-dependent; invalid scores preserve text and can fall back to YuE2 planning.

## 1.1.6 - 2026-09-11

- Preview the source song and reference voice immediately after file selection, with native playback, seeking, duration and file replacement controls.
- Keep players outside file-input overlays, release replaced file URLs, pause the other upload preview, and show a helpful message for unsupported browser audio formats.
- Verify WAV/FLAC playback, replacement, seeking, cleanup and narrow-screen layout in the browser. This release does not change inference backends.

## 1.1.5 - 2026-09-11

- Bound NAR attention query tiles on CUDA, select supported fused kernels explicitly, and fall back to bounded math with limited OOM retries. Enable AR offload by default without truncating songs or changing BF16, seeds, CFG, or solver steps.
- Save verified plan, semantic and latent checkpoints; resume failed generation and exact-plan rendering without repeating completed stages.
- Run reference-cover generation and conversion as a persistent backend workflow with sequential GPU workers, cancellation, stage progress and resource logs.
- Save and verify voice separation/conversion checkpoints; preserve a visible result or failure card across browser refreshes and provide recovery buttons.
- Show completed audio, duration and a direct download above the current page's form. Persist its page association and selected tab, restore older cover results, and preserve the player during polling.
- Add regressions for attention correctness, OOM bounds, cancellation, checkpoint integrity, workflow ordering, page refresh and mobile failure display.

## 1.1.4 - 2026-09-11

- Add an in-page model directory setting with the active path, bundled-default reset, folder opener, model layout guidance, and a direct Hugging Face link.
- Apply the configured model root consistently to generation, transcription, score rendering, reference-voice conversion, provenance, verification, and model downloads.
- Add a command-line model path configurator and prepare code-only GitHub Release assets with checksums and a machine-readable update manifest that preserves models and user data.

## 1.1.3 - 2026-09-11

- Restore the vendored YuE2 inference package in standalone archives so generation and reference-voice cover flows can start.
- Show the final worker exception in failed jobs and add in-page task-log viewing plus buttons that open the managed log and output directories.
- Reject jobs before queueing when their generation, transcription, or voice-conversion capability is incomplete, with a specific repair message.

## 1.1.2 - 2026-09-11

- Automatically switch from another idle YuE2 installation that already owns port 8189 after verifying the exact service process and executable path.
- Refuse to switch while the other installation has a running or queued task, and identify the protected task in the launcher message.

## 1.1.1 - 2026-09-11

- Add a native `YuE2-T8.exe` launcher for the standalone Windows bundle, while keeping the batch launcher as a compatibility entry point.
- Keep launcher windows open after both successful and failed starts so the service URL or failure reason remains visible.
- Show localized runtime checks, service startup progress, stale-service guidance, and log locations instead of silently closing.

## 1.1.0 - 2026-09-11

- Add local zero-shot reference-voice covers with Demucs vocal separation, Seed-VC conversion, and 48 kHz stereo remixing.
- Add the `YuE2 参考音色翻唱` ComfyUI node and a fourth front-end workflow using separate source-song and reference-voice inputs.
- Add an isolated Python 3.11 voice runtime, offline model verification, detailed capability checks, and local-only worker stages.
- Redesign the WebUI cover page as two integrated choices: melody remake or reference voice, with novice guidance and advanced voice controls.
- Validate the WebUI layout, a 30-step live service conversion, and a real ComfyUI `/prompt` execution.

## 1.0.7 - 2026-09-11

- Move live task progress into the page flow above the active workspace and remove the large fixed overlay and duplicate creation status card.
- Keep the current task, stage steps, queued task order, task summaries, and cancellation controls visible in one compact section.
- Add the creator credit and direct GitHub, Hugging Face model, Bilibili, and YouTube links to the local WebUI.

## 1.0.6 - 2026-09-11

- Replace the ambiguous single-job drawer with a live task center that identifies the current task and lists every queued task in execution order.
- Show localized task types, human-readable stages, source, style summary, elapsed/submitted time, and task-specific cancellation controls.
- Lock submit buttons immediately, reflect queued/running/cancelling state in place, and restore active tasks from the server after page refresh.
- Deduplicate identical active requests server-side and remove cancelled queued work from the logical queue immediately.
- Separate runtime readiness from GPU workload, remove the misleading fake progress bar, and add responsive and reduced-motion task-center styles.

## 1.0.5 - 2026-09-11

- Bind staged inference to the exact manifest-recorded files and recursively verify plan, semantic, and latent lineage while preserving compatibility with 1.0.4 manifests.
- Protect queued and running job dependencies from retention, serialize reads and exports with cleanup, and publish exports atomically with collision-safe names.
- Reject non-loopback Host headers, acquire a per-installation instance lock and bind the service port before job recovery, and make CUDA/BF16 self-check failures explicit.
- Pin model source identities in code, make provenance comparison insensitive to unrelated manifest formatting, and reject placeholder runtime files.
- Preserve transcription errors, prevent missing ABC from silently becoming a new composition, and add transcription manifests with source-audio and output hashes.
- Refresh the local WebUI with the light pink, blue, and slate palette used by the T8star IndexTTS 2.5 integration.

## 1.0.4 - 2026-09-11

- Add independent semantic, latent, and decode manifests with file hashes, pinned model sources, runtime weight identities, and stage-to-stage lineage verification.
- Add configurable automatic retention for terminal jobs, uploads, and logs, plus manual cleanup and storage reporting in the WebUI.
- Rotate service logs and keep exported artifacts outside automatic retention.
- Re-run full song generation, transcription, and staged semantic/synthesis/decode validation on the current release.

## 1.0.3 - 2026-09-10

- Block job-ID path traversal in file and artifact export APIs.
- Preserve cancellation through VAE decoding and terminate the complete worker process tree when stopping the service.
- Use collision-free atomic status writes and accurate token counters.
- Validate model bundle hashes and every installer subprocess; handle missing and per-protocol Windows proxy settings.
- Detect stale or conflicting local services, preserve successful candidates on a later candidate failure, and fix WebUI multi-job tracking.
- Validate full model layouts and reject unsupported batched transcription input.

## 1.0.2 - 2026-09-10

- Use the current `comfy node install yue2-t8` CLI command in the README.

## 1.0.1 - 2026-09-10

- Pin the installer to the verified `t8star/YuE2-Comfy` model bundle commit.
- Fix Registry links and Windows launcher packaging.

## 1.0.0 - 2026-09-10

- Initial Comfy Registry release.
- Add 11 nodes for song generation, editable ABC plans, transcription, cover generation, staged inference, artifact export, and cancellation.
- Add an isolated Windows runtime so the YuE2 dependencies do not replace ComfyUI's Torch installation.
- Add the local WebUI, shared single-GPU scheduler, example workflows, and resumable model setup.
